# odin-recipes project
## Introduction:
This project will focus on how to build a basic recipe website. It will allows me to showcase what I've learnt from the foundational course in [Odin: Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/) like git and Github as well as some basic HTML. I'm going create the following pages:
1. Lasagna
2. Pumpkin pancake
3. Fried chicken
